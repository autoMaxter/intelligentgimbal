A gimbal is a device designed to keep an object level as its surroundings change by rotating the object about a single axis. In this case, our gimbal will consist of a three ring axis mount in order to keep a camera level. The ISC participates in the annual Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition (IGVC) and is always looking for new/innovative ways to improve their design. Since the robot relies highly on its vision control, stabilizing its eyes will have a positive impact on its ability to navigate rough terrain.

In todayâ€™s world, gimbals are used for a variety of reasons ranging from camera stabilization for television & movie production to aiding autonomous vehicles for military purposes, navigation of ships, submarines and aircrafts as well as aerospace navigation. One of the most recent uses has been for camera stabilization with autonomous vehicles designed to compete in competitions such as DARPA (Defense advanced research projects agency) and IGVC which are development organizations for the Department of Defense.
